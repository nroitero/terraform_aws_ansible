# Terraform_aws_ansible

provision with ansible inside terraform to deploy a spring project


---
## Notes

- I choosed to create the 2 server with a count variable because it was more challenging

- I added the [terraform-aws-key-pair](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-key-pair) module to automate the keypair process

- ami images are searched to be last ubuntu xenial from canonical

- *with_volume_attached* : boolean variable, set to true to attach a 1go volume to /opt (allow to store data between instances) 

- created a check waiting for the webpage to be available therefore previous instance will be destroyed only when new is online (avoid downtime)
- ansible clone the java source from [java_terraform_app_example](https://github.com/nroitero/java_terraform_app_example)
### terraform.tfvars file

```bash
region = "eu-west-1" # region where you want your vpc to run
server_count = 2 # number of application servers do not decrease after first run
domain = "example.com" # will create application server hostname type app-{count.index}.{domain}
ansible_verbosity = "-vvv" # change ansible verbosity 
with_volume_attached = true #  boolean variable, set to true to attach a 1go volume to /opt (allow to store data between instances) 

```

## Structure

**ansible** - folder with ansible playbooks and configuration

**aws** - folder with terraform infrastructure files

**imgs** - documentation images

**secrets** - generated folder with keypair files

**tools** contains various shell scripts 

---
## Install prerequisites

Simply install aws, terraform and ansible following official documentation for your operating system

[Install aws](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html)

[Install terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)

[Install ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)


## Prepare 

clone the repository on your local machine and access the directory
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/nroitero/terraform_aws_ansible
$ cd terraform_aws_ansible
```

Before creating the infrastructure, we need to install the plugins for Terraform by typing 

```bash
$ terraform init aws
```
## Credentials

create an amazon account if you don't have already one

after signin in your AWS Management Console, go to “Identity and Access Management – IAM” section:

![iam](imgs/iam.png )


Then, click on “Add user” :

![iam add](imgs/iam-add.png )


Assign a username for the new account and select “Programmatic access“:
![iam name](imgs/iam-name.png )
Add “AmazonEC2FullAccess” to user permissions list:


![iam permission](imgs/iam-permission.png )


Next, click on “Review” then “Create User“:
![iam keys](imgs/iam-keys.png )


Copy to clipboard the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key, then set them to ~/.aws/credentials by running the command below and filling the appropriate fields (only credential values matters)

```bash
$ aws configure
```

## Usage

to check your changes before applying run
```bash
$ terraform plan aws  
```
Apply the configuration with:

```bash
$ terraform apply aws  
```
or if you want to skip confirmation
```bash
$ terraform apply -auto-approve aws 
```
and wait for the command to complete

### first time run:

After first deployment you will have to wait a few for the instances to register on the load balancer 


## Configuration changes

### Change instance type
 For any change in configuration which might cause a downtime
 you should taint instances  before applying (create_before_destroy triggering)

 ex:
 ```bash
terraform taint aws_instance.server.0 
 ```
or use 
```bash
./taint_aws_instances.sh 
```
to taint all existing instances


### Add/remove a new instance

raise the count number in terraform.tfvars

please ***do not decrease*** the count or you will run into know bug 
 
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/16626

instead you can create and destroy instances in seperated .tf file 

*ex: aws/3rd_instance.tf.bak*

## todo
- create roles and policies
- add ssl (add route 53 for letsencrypt  )
- improve the java app to display relevant data
- make it works on centos
